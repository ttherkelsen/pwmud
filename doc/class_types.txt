3 different class paradigms are useful for PWMud:

Objects - These classes extend (either directly or indirectly) the
Core object (/core/classes/core) and are meant to be cloned or loaded
as needed

Classes - Similar to objects, except they are only meant to be
inherited by other classes.  They should not be cloned or loaded.

Mixins - Similar to Classes, except they do not extend the Core object.
